Dijkstra's Algorithm
Send Feedback
ID: 1725

Given an undirected, connected and weighted graph G(V, E) with V number of vertices (which are numbered from 0 to V-1) and E number of edges.
Find and print the shortest distance from the source vertex (i.e. Vertex 0) to all other vertices (including source vertex also) using Dijkstra's Algorithm.
Input Format :
Line 1: Two Integers V and E (separated by space)
Next E lines : Three integers ei, ej and wi, denoting that there exists an edge between vertex ei and vertex ej with weight wi (separated by space)
Output Format :
For each vertex, print its vertex number and its distance from source, in a separate line. The vertex number and its distance needs to be separated by a single space.
Note : Order of vertices in output doesn't matter.
Constraints :
2 <= V, E <= 10^5
Time Limit: 1 sec
Sample Input 1 :
4 4
0 1 3
0 3 5
1 2 1
2 3 8
Sample Output 1 :
0 0
1 3
2 4
3 5
